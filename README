A simple game I'm making as a progamming exercise.

Made using Haskell and gloss.

TODO:
	for click-and-drag panning, record the inital offset of the mouse curser from (0,0). Then we can just snap to something

	clean up KBM (remove everything)

	clean up Game

	re-add clicking on a hex. Needs a reverse of 'coords' i.e. 'hex :: (Float,Float) -> Pos'

	add a lens iso for Pos and (Int,Int) or whatever
